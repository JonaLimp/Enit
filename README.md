    Data Collection: Automated background tasks (e.g., using Celery) to periodically collect environmental data.
    DevOps: Emphasizes best practices in containerization (Docker), CI/CD pipelines, and automated deployment for efficient development and scaling.
    Monitoring & Scaling: Integrated with monitoring tools like Grafana and real-time alerts to ensure system reliability and performance.

Purpose:

This project is part of my portfolio, designed to deepen my knowledge in:
